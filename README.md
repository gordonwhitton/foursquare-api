This is a Java Wrapper class making use of Foursquare REST services.

It is intended that this be used as an API to access Foursquare data.

Functionality is contained within the FourSquareApi.java class.

Before being able to use this API, you will need to sign up for a Foursquare developers account.  See https://foursquare.com/login?continue=%2Fdevelopers%2Fapps

Once you have an account, create an app within the Foursquare website.  Once complete, you will need to obtain the CLIENT_ID and CLIENT_SECRET from your new app, to pass as arguments into the constructor of FourSquareApi.java.

For convenience, I have included a demo cmd line app, the use of which should be self explanatory.
